Buttons:
#### Remove - 
You will be asked to insert a node ID to remove from the graph. 
 
 #### Load - 
 You will be asked to insert a name of a graph you want to load to the GUI. 
 Note that you ONLY need to insert the name of the graph, without it's path and without the '.json' at the end. 
 The graph will have to be in the /data folder and be a json type. 
 
 #### Save - 
 You will be asked to give a name to the graph you want to save. 
 The graph will be saved at the /data folder and will be a json type. 
 Note that if you give it a name that already exists, it WILL override the old graph. 
 
 #### Center - 
 The center node will be colored blue. 
 
 #### Path Dist - 
 You will be asked to enter a source and destination IDs. 
 Then a message will pop with the cost of the journey between the two nodes. 
 
  #### Path -
